The logic of the program
    This program allows 3 passengers to get on the boat to be delivered
    to the other side of the river. Passengers come and wait for the 
    boat to be ready. When the boat is ready, it allows 3 passengers
    to enter the boat, as long as they fit the criterion that 2 cannibals
    cannot travel with 1 missionary. After loading, the boat goes for a 
    ride and allows the passengers to get off on the other side of the
    river.

Why does your program work?
    My program uses a monitor as the core of it's functionality. The 
    monitor ensures mutual exclusion as code is executed. The monitor
    procedures, CannibalArrives(), MissionaryArrives(), BoatReady() and 
    BoatDone() control the flow of the boat and passengers as the 
    problem runs. 

Variable explanations
    waiting - holds the number of passengers waiting to board the boat,
              it's used in notifing the boat that passengers are
              available
    canWaiting - the number of cannibals waiting, used in passenger
                 decision process
    missWaiting - the number of missionaries waiting, used in passenger
                  decision process
    onBoat - number of threads currently on the boat, used to keep track
             of when threads may get on the boat.
    boatState - used to know if the boat is present and ready or hauling
                threads across the river
    Riding - Condition to prevent riding passengers from exiting
    CannibalHere - Condition to block cannibals from boarding
    MissionaryHere - Condition to block missionaries from boarding
    BoatWaiting - Condition to block boat for passengers
    BoatLoading - Condition to block boat for loading

Boat has 3 persons
    When the boat is ready for loading, it enters a decision process
    and only allows 3 threads to board the boat. If no passengers are
    waiting, boat waits until threads are available to board. Threads
    can only board if the boat is in the READY state and there are less
    than 3 threads on the boat, if not the thread is blocked. Threads
    on the boat are blocked until the boat Signals them when the ride
    is over so no threads can jump off. boat is blocked until 3rd thread
    gets on the boat and signals it to go.

Assembling a safe boat load
    The boat will take passengers are random from the waiting pool, it
    will either, take 3 missionaries, take 3 cannibals, or take 2 missionaries
    and 1 cannibal. No other combinations are possible as the boat loads
    threads in a group. If there is not a proper combination, the boat
    is blocked until a combination appears and signals the boat. Boat 
    signals the threads that are a part of the combination that they may
    board.

CannibalArrives
    First checks if the cannibal can board the boat or not based on
    the waiting passengers, boat state, and number of passengers on 
    board. If it can't board, it is blocked. If it can, the thread
    boards the boat and blocks itself for riding.

MissionaryArrives
    First checks if the missionary can board the boat or not based on
    the waiting passengers, boat state, and number of passengers on 
    board. If it can't board, it is blocked. If it can, the thread
    boards the boat and blocks itself for riding.

BoatReady
    If threads are waiting, the boat will allow 3 threads to join
    the boat as long as the threads fit the right combination. If
    3 threads that fit the possible combinations are not available
    the boat is blocked until 3 are available

BoatDone
    Boat done signals the riding passengers so they may get off the boat
